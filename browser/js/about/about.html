        DailySheets is a site designed for parents and daycare staff to communicate about a child's day.  Parents can log on and see about their child's day, records are kept online so it's easy to see the history of a child's day. This will be especially useful for doctor's visits and other times when parents want to see a history of their child's daily activity. This system makes it easier for our staff to keep track of an infant's day.
